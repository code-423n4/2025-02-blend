‚ÑπÔ∏è This audit includes **deployed code,** and [the "live criticals" exception](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#the-live-criticals-exception) therefore applies. Please see the section titled "Live/Deployed Code" for details.

**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Live/Deployed Code

For the purposes of the ["live criticals" exception](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#the-live-criticals-exception) and [sensitive disclosure process](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-guidelines#how-to-submit-zero-day-or-otherwise-highly-sensitive-bugs), contracts in the following directories should be considered live code, as they have only changed incrementally from the V1 code, which is deployed: 
- `./pool/*`
- `./pool-factory/*`
- `./backstop/*`

All other code in scope is _not_ deployed. Vulnerabilities with a root cause in any part of the codebase _except_ the above-listed directories should therefore be submitted via the standard submission form/process.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-02-blend/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

Any uncovered issues will be logged here: https://github.com/blend-capital/blend-contracts-v2/issues

# Additional context

## Main invariants

* User's cannot extract funds (borrow, withdraw) from a pool if they do not meet or exceed the minimum health factor

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
## Auctions

The protocol conducts auctions to both process liquidations and pay out backstop interest. Anything that can disrupt / block / break the creation or filling of these auctions has potential to impact the health of a pool and/or it's backstop.

The auction creation system was modified in v2 to allow auction creators to specify the assets in the bid/lot. https://github.com/blend-capital/blend-contracts-v2/issues/3

## Flash Loans

Blend v2 introduces a flash loans endpoint. These are slightly different than EVM based flash loans, but still allow external contracts to be invoked. with borrowed funds, and repaid afterwards, or remain borrowed with the appropriate amount of collateral.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

Pool
* admin - can add reserves, edit reserve configs, and edit pool config (EXCL. ORACLE)

Backstop
* N/A

Emitter
* N/A

Pool Factory
* N/A

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ using the template belowüëá

| Role                                | Description                       |

| Owner                          | Has superpowers                |
| Administrator                             | Can change fees                       |

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

* Interest uses a capped integral controller to adjust the interest rates to help utilization reach the target utilization rate: https://docs.blend.capital/blend-whitepaper#interest-rates
